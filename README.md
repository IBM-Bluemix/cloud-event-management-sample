# Starter Application For Cloud Event Management

This is a starter application for the [Cloud Event Management][provision_url] service in Bluemix, that demonstrates how to create, map, and send events via the API using a simple Node.js web application.

The application performs two functions:

1. It serves a simple web page that sends a predefined event to Cloud Event Management when the user presses a button. Use this part of the code as a template for sending in your own predefined events.

2. It exposes an API endpoint that can be used to map incoming [Prometheus][prometheus_url] events and forward them to Cloud Event Management. Use this part of the code as a template for mapping events from any other unsupported event source.

For more information, see the [API documentation][api_docs_url].

## Cloud Event Management Overview
Use [Cloud Event Management][video_url] to set up real-time incident management for your services, applications, and infrastructure. Cloud Event Management can receive events from various monitoring sources, either on premise or in the cloud. Events indicate that something has happened on an application, service, or another monitored object. Related events are correlated into an incident. The information from incidents, together with policies and runbooks, help operations teams identify underlying problems and restore service.

## Running the app on Bluemix

1. Before running this app, you will need an instance of the Cloud Event Management service. Get one [here][provision_url].

2. Download and install the [Cloud Foundry CLI][cloud_foundry_url] tool

3. Clone the app to your local environment from your terminal

4. `cd` into this newly created directory

5. Open the manifest.yml file and change the host value to something unique.

  The host you choose will determine the subdomain of your application's URL: `<host>.mybluemix.net`

6. Connect to Bluemix in the command line tool and follow the prompts to log in

  ```
  $ cf api https://api.ng.bluemix.net
  $ cf login
  ```

  If asked to select a space, select the one that contains your Cloud Event Management instance.

7. Confirm that you are in the correct space with:

  ```
  cf services
  ```

  You should see your Cloud Event Management instance listed.  Make a note of the instance name.

8. Push the app to Bluemix.

  ```
  $ cf push
  ```

  When the command finishes, you should see the `<host>.mybluemix.net` URL in the output.  This will be the URL at which you can access the sample app.

9. Bind the Cloud Event Management service to the app, where `<instance_name>` is the name from Step 7.
  ```
  $ cf bind-service CEMSampleApp "<instance_name>"
  ```

10. Restage the app
  ```
  $ cf restage CEMSampleApp
  ```

11. Access the running app in a browser at the URL from Step 8


## Running the app locally

1. [Install Node.js][install_node_url]

2. Clone the app to your local environment

3. cd into the app directory

4. Edit `config.js` and fill in your Cloud Event Management instance name, username and password:

  ```
var defaults = {
      cloudeventmanagement: {
        url: 'https://ibmeventmgt-bm-eventpreprocessor.mybluemix.net/api/events/demo/v1',
        name: '',
        password: '',
      }
}
  ```
  This will allow the starter app to authenticate with Cloud Event Management and send events.

5. Run `npm install` to install the app's dependencies

6. Run `npm start` to start the app

7. Access the running app in a browser at the address specified by the terminal output, e.g.:
  ```
  Server starting on http://localhost:6001
  ```

## Using the app

1. Once you've navigated to the app in your browser, you can press the button to send an event to Cloud Event Management.  Try modifying the code to change the summary and severity of the event, or to include form data submitted by the user.  The full schema for Cloud Event Management events is available in [the API documentation][api_docs_event_url].

2. If you are running the app on Bluemix, you can configure Prometheus to send alerts to it.  [Configure a webhook receiver][prometheus_config_url] in Prometheus that points to `http://<host>.mybluemix.net/api/prometheus`, and the app will map any incoming alerts to Cloud Event Management events, then send them to the API.

  If you are running the app locally, you can simulate this behavior by sending the provided sample Prometheus alerts generated by Kubernetes, e.g.:
  ```
  curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X POST http://localhost:6001/api/prometheus -d "$(cat ./sample-events/prometheus-firing.json)"
  ```
  If you have other webhook-based event sources, try adding more endpoints to the code to start receiving those events, or check out the existing integrations in Cloud Event Management under **Administration** > **Event Sources**.
